Problem:
Show for all finite xs that
length (reverse xs ) = length xs

length (reverse []) = length []          ----(base)
length (reverse xs) = length xs          ----(hyp)
length (reverse (x:xs)) = length (x:xs)  ----(ind)
Proof:
Base
 We look separately at the two sides of (base).
 left-hand side,
 length (reverse [])
 = length ([])
 = 0
 right-hand side,
 length []
 = 0

	which shows their equality.

Induction
First we look at the left-hand side of (ind)
length (reverse (x:xs))
= length (reverse xs ++ [x])
= length (reverse xs) + length [x]
= length (reverse xs) + 1
by (hyp)
= length xs + 1

Now, looking at the right-hand side of (ind) we get
length (x:xs)
= 1 + length xs

This shows that (ind) follows from (hyp), completing the second half of the proof and so the proof itself.
