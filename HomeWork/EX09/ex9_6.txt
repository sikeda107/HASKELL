Problem:
Prove the two rules for ++;
xs ++ [] = xs
xs ++ (ys ++ zs) = (xs ++ ys) ++ zs
for all finite xs,ys and zs.

Proof:
xs ++ [] = xs                             ----(base)
xs ++ (ys ++ zs) = (xs ++ ys) ++ zs       ----(ind)
length (xs ++ ys) = length xs + length ys ----(hyp)
Base
 We look separately at the two sides of (base).
 left-hand side,
 length (xs ++ [])
 = length xs
 right-hand side,
 length xs

 which shows their equality.

Induction
 First we look at the left-hand side of (ind)
 length (xs ++ (ys ++ zs))
 by (hyp)
 = length xs + length (ys ++ zs)
 = length xs + length ys + length zs

 Now, looking at the right-hand side of (ind) we get
 length (xs ++ ys) ++ zs
 by (hyp)
 = length (xs ++ ys) + length zs
 = length xs + length ys + length zs

 This shows that (ind) follows from (hyp), completing the second half of the proof and so the proof itself.
